# ProducerConsumer

Steps to run

cmake ./

make

./ProducerConsumer/ProducerConsumer in.txt out.txt countingsort

The optimal sorting algoritm chosen is counting sort. Since the numbers are 0-9, its easy to just iterate once over the characters and generate a count table.

The secondary choice is bubble sort, due to its ease of implementation, in place operation, and relatively good time/space complexity.
